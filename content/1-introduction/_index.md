# Introduction to ECS Advanced Networking

## What is Amazon ECS?

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. ECS eliminates the need to install and operate your own container orchestration software, manage and scale a cluster of virtual machines, or schedule containers on those virtual machines.

## ECS Networking Overview

ECS provides several networking modes and features that enable you to build sophisticated, production-ready containerized applications:

### Network Modes

1. **awsvpc Mode** (Recommended)
   - Each task gets its own elastic network interface (ENI)
   - Direct VPC integration with security groups
   - Enhanced security and monitoring capabilities

2. **Bridge Mode**
   - Default Docker bridge networking
   - Port mapping required for external access
   - Shared network namespace on host

3. **Host Mode**
   - Direct access to host networking
   - Highest performance but less isolation
   - Limited port availability

### Key Networking Components

#### Service Discovery
- **AWS Cloud Map**: DNS-based service discovery
- **Service Connect**: Simplified service-to-service communication
- **Load Balancer Integration**: Automatic registration/deregistration

#### Load Balancing
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Layer 7 load balancing
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Layer 4 load balancing
- **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**: Legacy option

#### Security
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls for tasks
- **Network ACLs**: Subnet-level security
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private connectivity to AWS services

## Workshop Architecture

In this workshop, we'll build the comprehensive ECS networking solution shown in the architecture diagram below:

### Architecture Components

The solution includes:

1. **Multi-AZ VPC Design**
   - Public subnets for load balancers and NAT gateways
   - Private subnets for ECS tasks and internal services
   - Internet Gateway for public internet access
   - NAT Gateways for secure outbound connectivity

2. **ECS Fargate Cluster**
   - Serverless container platform
   - Tasks deployed across multiple availability zones
   - Automatic scaling and load distribution

3. **Application Load Balancer**
   - Layer 7 load balancing with advanced routing
   - Health checks and target group management
   - SSL/TLS termination capabilities

4. **Service Discovery**
   - AWS Cloud Map integration
   - DNS-based service resolution
   - Automatic service registration/deregistration

5. **Security Implementation**
   - Security groups for network-level access control
   - VPC endpoints for private AWS service access
   - Network segmentation best practices

6. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - CloudWatch integration for metrics and logs
   - VPC Flow Logs for network traffic analysis
   - Application and infrastructure monitoring

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. **Design ECS Network Architecture**
   - Choose appropriate network modes
   - Plan VPC and subnet strategies
   - Implement security best practices

2. **Implement Service Discovery**
   - Configure AWS Cloud Map
   - Set up DNS-based service discovery
   - Manage service registration/deregistration

3. **Configure Advanced Load Balancing**
   - Set up Application Load Balancers
   - Implement path-based routing
   - Configure health checks and sticky sessions

4. **Secure ECS Networks**
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Configure VPC endpoints
   - Set up encryption in transit

5. **Monitor and Troubleshoot**
   - Set up CloudWatch monitoring
   - Analyze VPC Flow Logs
   - Troubleshoot connectivity issues

## Prerequisites Review

Before starting this workshop, ensure you have:

- **AWS Account** with administrative access
- **AWS CLI** installed and configured
- **Docker** installed locally (for testing)
- **Basic networking knowledge** (VPC, subnets, routing)
- **Container experience** (Docker, containerization concepts)

## Workshop Flow

This workshop is structured as a progressive learning experience:

1. **Foundation**: Set up VPC and ECS cluster
2. **Core Services**: Deploy containerized applications
3. **Service Discovery**: Enable service-to-service communication
4. **Load Balancing**: Implement traffic distribution
5. **Security**: Add network security layers
6. **Monitoring**: Set up observability
7. **Cleanup**: Remove all resources

Each section builds upon the previous one, creating a complete, production-ready ECS networking solution that matches the architecture diagram.
