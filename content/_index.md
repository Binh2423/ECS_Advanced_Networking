### What You'll Learn

- **ECS Network Modes**: Understanding awsvpc, bridge, and host networking modes
- **Service Discovery**: Implementing AWS Cloud Map and service mesh patterns
- **Load Balancing**: Advanced ALB/NLB configurations and traffic routing
- **Security**: Network segmentation, VPC endpoints, and encryption
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration and troubleshooting techniques

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of AWS services (VPC, EC2, IAM)
- Familiarity with containerization concepts
- Experience with Docker and container orchestration
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions

### Workshop Duration

**6 hours** - Hands-on workshop with real AWS environment

### Architecture Overview

This workshop will guide you through building the production-ready ECS architecture shown above, featuring:

- **Custom VPC** with public and private subnets across multiple AZs
- **ECS Fargate** cluster with containerized applications
- **Application Load Balancer** with advanced routing capabilities
- **Service Discovery** using AWS Cloud Map for seamless service communication
- **Security Groups** and network ACLs for proper network segmentation
- **CloudWatch** monitoring and logging for observability
- **NAT Gateways** for secure outbound internet access from private subnets

### Key Components

The architecture demonstrates:

- **Multi-AZ deployment** for high availability
- **Private subnet placement** for ECS tasks to enhance security
- **Load balancer integration** for traffic distribution
- **Service mesh capabilities** through service discovery
- **Monitoring and logging** integration with CloudWatch

### Cost Estimation

- **Workshop Duration**: ~$15-25 in AWS charges
- **Resources**: ECS Fargate, ALB, VPC endpoints, CloudWatch, NAT Gateways
- **Cleanup**: All resources will be deleted at the end

> **Important**: Make sure to follow the cleanup instructions at the end to avoid ongoing charges!
